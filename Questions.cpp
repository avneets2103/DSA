//1. Given an array of length N, you need to find and return the sum of all elements of the array.
//2. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find if x is present in the array or not. Return true or false.
//3. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the first index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
//   First index means, the index of first occurrence of x in the input array.
//4. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
//   Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.
//5.Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find all the indexes where x is present in the input array. Save all the indexes in an array (in increasing order). 
//6. Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
//7. Given two integers M & N, calculate and return their multiplication using recursion. You can only use subtraction and addition for your calculation. No other operators are allowed.
//8. Given an integer N, count and return the number of zeros that are present in the given integer using recursion.
//9. Sum till kth term of gp with a=1 and r = 1/2
//10.Check if the number is a pallindrome or not
//11.Find sum of all digits from entered integer recursively.
